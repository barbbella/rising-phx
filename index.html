    <p>
    Rising Phoenix is a volunteer operation to provide real-life career and life help to religious cult survivors.
    Cult survivors may experience any combination of cultural deprivation, emotional and physical abuse, financial abuse,
    and delayed career development.
    </p><p>
    We support all gender identities, sexual orientations, races and ethnicities, and religions. It is required that all
    volunteers and survivors are inclusive of this diversity as well. Sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, whorephobia,
    classism, and shaming of any kind is not tolerated.
    </p><p>
    This is a small operation and some of the resources linked here are external. We hope to grow and be able to help more
    people in more situations, but resources are limited and this is what we can do now.
